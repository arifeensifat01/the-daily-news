   <h4>About</h4>
   <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.
    Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over" being a set of 6 faiopportunities for the batting team to score) and the game generally lasting three hours, to Test matches played over five daysTraditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kitsome players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the BritisEmpire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International CrickeCouncil (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules, the Laws of Cricketare maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London. The sport is followed primarily in South Asia, Australasia, the United KingdomSouthern Africa and the West Indies.Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard. The most successful side playininternational cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any othecountry and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country. <br><br>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word footbalnormally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include associatiofootball (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football)Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.
    
    There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.[2][3][4] Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.[5][6] The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.</p>
